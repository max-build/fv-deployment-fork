# Football Victoria Referee Management Platform

This project is a full-stack, web application for managing referee appointments and availability for Football Victoria. The Football Victoria Referees department aims to provide a better experience for referees when appointing them to soccer matches by improving their current process with automation and convenience oriented UX design. This platform adds graphical visualisation to the existing Referees Appointment System.

## Project Overview

The main goals of this platform are:

- Match referees to appointments based on location, experience, maturity, and appropriate age
- Improve accuracy, timing, and flexibility in the appointment process
- Address the issue of mass declines in age groups of U12, 13, and 14's fixtures
- Ensure higher acceptance of appointments
